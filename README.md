# Problem Statement
===============================
## conference-track-planner

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

* The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.  
* Each session contains multiple talks.  
* Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.  
* Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.  
* The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.  
* No talk title has numbers in it.  
* All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).  
* Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.  

_**NOTE: Depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.**_

# Solution
===============

1) There are two sessions - 
	- Morning session - 180 mins(9:00am to 12:00pm), 
	- Lunch Break - 60 mins (12:00pm to 1:00pm) 
	- Afternoon Session - 240mins(1:00pm to 5:00pm) 
	- Network event starts at 5 O'clock

2) First reading from the file and creating a talk-list by parsing the title, duration etc
3) Arranging all the tasks in descending order based on their duration
4) Now, process the each Talk track by track. 
5) Incase track count is 2, then first processing for track-1 and allocating the 'n' no of Talks,
6) Then on next round processing rest talks (total talks - 'n' talks) for next track until all talks get allocated.
7) Now, pick up the Talk one by one and allocate till morning session is available, means unless it goes beyond 180 mins
8) Same processing doing for afternoon session also unless it goes beyond 240 mins.
9) At the End, it returns number of Talks that has been allocated for that particular Track
10) And then leftover Talks are processed for next track
11) During 12:00pm to 1:00pm marking as Lunch Break
12) At 5:00pm marking as Networking Event
